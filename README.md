## Project Overview

### Technologies Used

- **Python:** Cryptex's backend logic is written in Python, a versatile and powerful programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python's extensive ecosystem and libraries facilitate efficient development and integration of encryption algorithms and web services.

- **Django:** Cryptex utilizes the Django web framework, a high-level Python framework renowned for its scalability, security, and rapid development capabilities. Django's built-in features, including authentication, session management, and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), streamline the development process and ensure robustness and reliability.

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** The frontend interface of Cryptex is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing users with an intuitive and responsive user experience. HTML structures the content, CSS styles the layout and appearance, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the web application.

- **SQLite3:** Cryptex employs SQLite3 as its relational database management system. SQLite3 is lightweight, serverless, and self-contained, making it ideal for small to medium-scale web applications like Cryptex. It provides efficient data storage and retrieval capabilities while ensuring data integrity and reliability.

- **Cryptography Libraries:** Cryptex utilizes cryptography libraries such as cryptography and pycryptodome to implement industry-standard encryption algorithms including RSA, AES, and SHA-256. These libraries provide robust cryptographic primitives and secure implementations, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data.

- **Version Control with Git:** Development of Cryptex is managed using Git, a distributed version control system. Git enables collaborative development, code versioning, and project management, allowing developers to work efficiently and effectively on the Cryptex codebase.
